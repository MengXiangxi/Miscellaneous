#Bootstrap Exhaustion

This is a exhaustion algorithm to solve a logical puzzle. The original puzzle was posted on Weibo by the account [江苏网警](https://weibo.com/5431447659/G5kJAkdqB?from=page_1001065431447659_profile).

The puzzle is self-consistent thus I call it a 'bootstrap' puzzle. And the original puzzle is herein attached.

I was amazed that the puzzle is so easily tackled by exhaustion, and it is worth demonstrating that with a very limited resource (a total cpu time of 648 ms on COLAB ipynb via Google Drive), one can solve seemingly difficult problems.
